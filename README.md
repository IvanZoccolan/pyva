GLWB pricing via dynamic programming 

Dynamic programming algorithm for pricing variable annuities with GLWB under a stochastic mortality framework.
The project contains classes to model the contract and the financial and mortality processes needed to set up the former. 
This code was used for the numerical section of the paper "Optimal withdrawal strategies in GLWB
variable annuities" by Bacinello et Al. (TBR).
